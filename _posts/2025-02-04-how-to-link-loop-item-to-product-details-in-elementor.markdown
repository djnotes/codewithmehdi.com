Elementor Loop Builder is a good tool for creating custom loop items that can then be used by Elementor to create product/post/etc. carousels. 
One thing that might be a little tricky is linking the item to the post link (permalink). 
Here's how to do it:  
- In the Loop item editor, select the image you want to be clickable, 
- Under Content, press the dropdown in front of Link.
- There is a special field beneath the link dropdown. Press the icon for Dynamic Labels in front of it. 
- A list of different items appears.
- Click "Post Link" and you are done. 
Now the item will be clickable on its cover image, i.e. users can click the image to go to the post or to product details in case of a product carousel.
